# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%d-%m-%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"

  # And much more! For more information, visit the docs: https://espanso.org/docs/
  
  # Email (placeholder substituted at install time by setup script)
  - trigger: ":email"
    replace: "__EMAIL__"

  # GitUser (placeholder substituted at install time by setup script)
  - trigger: ":user"
    replace: "__GIT_USER__"

  # Phone (placeholder substituted at install time by setup script)
  - trigger: ":phone"
    replace: "__PHONE__"

  - trigger: ":externalip"
    replace: "{{my_ip}}"
    vars:
      - name: my_ip
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "curl -s ifconfig.me"

  - trigger: ":ip"
    replace: "{{my_local_ip}}"
    vars:
      - name: my_local_ip
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'"
